    mydata:"PRP is a non-surgical hair restoration treatment that uses the patient’s own blood to stimulate the hair growth. It is a three-step medical treatment in which a patient’s blood is drawn, processed, and then injected into the scalp. PRP injections trigger natural hair growth and maintain it by increasing blood supply to the hair follicle and increasing the thickness of the hair shaft. Sometimes this approach is combined with other hair loss procedures or medications.",    },

      mydata:"Micro needling derma roller is a handheld device that has a small wheel with hundreds of tiny needles. When rolled over the skin, the derma roller makes tiny punctures in the skin. The body responds by sending collagen to the surface to heal the tiny wounds. This plumps the skin, reducing the appearance of scars, fine lines, and wrinkles. It can also help serums and other skin care products absorb into the skin more easily.",

Mesotherapy employs multiple injections of pharmaceutical and homeopathic medications, plant extracts, vitamins, and other ingredients into subcutaneous fat.

      mydata:"Scalp micropigmentation is a non-invasive treatment that uses detailed micro-needles to deposit pigment into the scalp. The result creates the appearance of tiny hair follicles that help thicken and restore the look of fuller hair. If you are starting to thin, recede, or if you are completely bald, we can give you the look of a short buzz cut. The SMP® technique involves no surgery, no scarring, and no hair pieces. ",
